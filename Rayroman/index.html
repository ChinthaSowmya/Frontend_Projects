<div id="d5"><article id="art4"><h2>Jamie Floyd: <b>Upper West Side Classic 6x</b></h2><br><span>"Ray Romano rocks. Listen to this: He did a complete GUT on an eight-room wreck in less than 8 weeks. I do not recommend it for anyone. It is CRAZY. But we have little kids and we had no choice. Ray Romano and his team got it done! The place is beautiful!"</span><br><br>
    <h2>Donna and Scott: <b> Rescued Renovation</b></h2><br>
<span>"Ray rescued us from a contractor job gone bad. He and his crew are great, neat and real artisans. We recommend him very highly and I bet before we know it, there will be another "Everybody loves Raymond," but on HGTV or TLC!"</span><br><br>
<h2>David Siegel: <b> Doubled the Value</b></h2><br>
<span>"Ray added value in ways that other G.C.s can't. Working with him is a pleasure. He more than doubled the value of my apartment through his gut renovations. I would recommend him to any person looking to make home improvements."</span></article> </div>
